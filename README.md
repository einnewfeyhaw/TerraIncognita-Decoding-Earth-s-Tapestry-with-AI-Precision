# TerraIncognita-Decoding-Earth-s-Tapestry-with-AI-Precision

## Overview

"Terra Incognita" is an AI-powered project that decodes the Earth's tapestry through precise semantic segmentation of aerial photography. The project is based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture, providing high accuracy in identifying and classifying different elements within aerial images.

## Features

- Semantic segmentation of aerial photographs.
- Trained on the FPN architecture for improved precision.
- Accurate identification and classification of Earth's features.

## Getting Started

To use this project for semantic segmentation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/einnewfeyhaw/TerraIncognita-Decoding-Earth-s-Tapestry-with-AI-Precision.git
cd TerraIncognita-Decoding-Earth-s-Tapestry-with-AI-Precision
